THUnitFrames 1.3a16
==================
You can adjust the position and scaling of the frames by entering the
slash command "/thuf" to bring up the THUnitFrames configuration window.
From here, you can unlock each frame individually to move them whereever
you want them, set scaling, and force frames that are currently invisible
(target, pet, target-of-target, party) to become visible so you can drag
them where you want them.

MobHealth Integration
=====================
If you have the MobHealth2 addon installed and enabled, the target
frame will automatically use it to show your target's estimated HP
and Max HP when the actual values aren't available.
